# Icon Project IXD304

## Research, Discovery and Supporting Sketches

I wanted to create something that both interests me and through my experience with social media and selling products daily online I felt plant based products is something people love and could use as screensavers, for business cards etc.  Botanical drawings, pictures of plants and flowers is something that is regurlarly popping up on my feed and pinterest board and is also something I love. Normally I would be painting leafy floral designs but have never explored what I could do using vector. 

I then started taking pictures of some plants I love and gathering some inspiration online to get me started. Below I have linked my inital sketches for my project to show my process to the end product.

## Icon Website


I wanted to try creating a horizontal scrolling website as I have a vision of walking along the garden. I haven't ended up using this website but have linked it to show a stage of my process. I was pleased as I now have a working prototype of a horizontal scrolling website even though it didnt up looking the way I had imagined.
Following this I then felt my designs would flow and look better on a vertical scrolling website. 

Here is my finished [Icon Site](https://amygrahamie.github.io/icons/styleguide.html)
